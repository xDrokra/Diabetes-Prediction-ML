# Diabetes-Prediction-ML
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques in the healthcare domain to predict diabetes in patients. The goal is to identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on factors such as glucose levels, insulin, BMI, and age, providing insights that could support early intervention and medical decision-making.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used is the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, sourced from Kaggle. It contains 768 entries and 9 attributes, encompassing patient information and health metrics.

### Data Dictionary

| Feature  | Description |
| -------  | ----------  |
| Pregnancies | Number of times the patient has been pregnant |
| Glucose | Plasma glucose concentration during a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test |
| BloodPressure | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| SkinThickness | Triceps skinfold thickness (mm) |
| Insulin | 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) |
| BMI | Body Mass Index, a measure of weight relative to height |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | A function assessing diabetes likelihood based on family history |
| Age | Age of the patient in years |
| Outcome | Binary label indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes |

This dataset provides a mix of numerical features and a clear target variable, making it well-suited for classification tasks. The project explores various machine learning algorithms, evaluates their performance, and identifies key health indicators influencing diabetes prediction.
